# Natural Language Processing Website

## About
This website was created for Udacity's Front End Developer nanodegree. 
Instead of using the base code provided by Udacity, I decided to build
everything from scratch.  
  
The website uses [AYLIEN](https://aylien.com/), a NLP API which can analyze 
bulk amounts of news articles \& free text.

## Usage
### How to run the front-end \& server

### How to run tests
