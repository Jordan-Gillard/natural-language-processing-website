# Natural Language Processing Website

## About
This website was created for Udacity's Front End Developer nanodegree. 
Instead of using the base code provided by Udacity, I decided to build
everything from scratch.  
  
The website uses [AYLIEN](https://aylien.com/), a NLP API which can analyze 
bulk amounts of news articles \& free text.

## Usage
### Install dependencies
In your terminal, type:
```terminal
npm install package.json
```

### How to run the backend server
In your terminal, type:
```terminal
npm run start-backend
```

### How to start the dev server
In your terminal, type:
```terminal
npm run start-dev-server
```
This will automatically open a webpage with index.html open. The dev build 
will be available under `dist/dev`

### How to create production build
In your terminal, type:
```terminal
npm run build-prod
```
The production build will be available under `dist/prod`

### How to create development build
In case you don't want to use the development server, you can create the 
dev build this way.
In your terminal, type:
```terminal
npm run build-dev
```
The production build will be available under `dist/dev`

### How to run tests
In your terminal, type:
```terminal
npm run test
```
